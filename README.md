 ## Car Insurance
     This projects is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's 
     input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an
     admin page that allows staff to view all the quotes that have been issued.

 ## NFL Stats
     This is a data visualization application that is meant to store and display football stats for
     the purposes of fantasy football. It is an MVC web application that utilizes Entity Framework 6
     for data access and a Code First workflow. It is still a work in progress.
